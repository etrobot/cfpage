### Bing:
Meta has been advising creators on what content they should post on Threads. The social network reportedly provided extensive guidelines on how marketers can integrate their brands on the platform in a leaked email. The message allegedly provided creators with content suggestions, engagement ideas, feature recommendations and specific examples of what makes a good post for inspiration¹.

Here are some tips on how to promote your product on Meta Threads:
- Make a grand entrance. Combine images, memes and “open-ended” questions to announce that a brand or influencer has joined Threads. Engage your followers by starting conversations or creating polls¹.
- Post a challenge or competition. Create your own challenges or contests – another example of posting content that will result in more content¹.
- Make use of puns… and talk about Threads. Puns are apparently a good shout for brands and influencers – with the leaked email even citing a Meta pun as an example: “Get ~Meta~ About Being On Threads.”¹
- Explore Threads’ existing tools. Brands and influencers are encouraged to use the Threads features that are currently available such as the ability to share up 10 photos in one post or five-minute-long video clips².

I hope this helps!
