Social media can be time consuming to manage. But AI tools like ChatGPT make it easy to automate content creation and posting. In this guide, I'll show you how I used ChatGPT and other AI tools to automatically generate and post content to Instagram daily. 

## Tools Used

- ChatGPT - for generating quotes, image ideas, captions 
- OpenAI API - to integrate ChatGPT
- Dall-E - for generating images 
- repurpose.io - for auto-posting to Instagram

## Steps

### 1. Generate inspirational quotes with ChatGPT

I prompted ChatGPT to generate inspirational quotes related to coding and development. This gives us unique content to base our posts on.

### 2. Generate image ideas with ChatGPT 

Next, I fed the quotes into ChatGPT again and asked it to generate creative image ideas related to the quotes. This resulted in descriptive image prompts without text.

### 3. Generate images with Dall-E

I used the image prompts from ChatGPT with Dall-E to generate colorful abstract images. This gave me images tailored to my Instagram's theme. 

### 4. Overlay quote text on images 

Using the Python Imaging Library, I wrote a script to overlay the inspirational quotes onto the generated images.

### 5. Convert images to short videos 

Instagram Reels need to be videos, so I converted the static images to 5 second video clips.

### 6. Generate captions with ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT again to create captivating captions and hashtags for each video based on the quote text.

### 7. Upload media to Google Drive

My script automatically uploaded the generated videos and captions to Google Drive.

### 8. Auto-post with repurpose.io

Finally, I connected my Google Drive to repurpose.io which automatically posts the videos to my Instagram account daily.

And that's it! The AI does all the hard work while I relax. Give it a try to save time and energize your Instagram growth. Let me know if you have any other questions!
