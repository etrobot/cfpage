## Overview

GPT Engineer is a new open source tool that utilizes AI to generate code by conversing with the user. It builds on top of capabilities from ChatGPT and the OpenAI API.

## How it Works

GPT Engineer allows prompts to be defined that specify requirements for an application. It then asks clarifying questions before generating code in languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The code is output into local files that can be executed to test the application.

## Benefits

- Automatically generates full code, not just snippets like ChatGPT
- Creates runnable local files 
- Asks clarifying questions for better results
- Iterates quickly based on feedback  

## Example Use Case

The tool was tested by defining a prompt to create a web page with a button that changes the background color and displays random images on click. GPT Engineer generated the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files. After executing, the web page worked as desired.

More complex prompts were also successfully generated, including additional text and layout requirements.

## Conclusion

GPT Engineer shows promise for quick prototyping and creation of minimum viable products. As the AI capabilities continue to improve, tools like this could greatly improve developer efficiency and productivity.
