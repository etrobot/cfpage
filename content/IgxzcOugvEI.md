The renowned philosopher and political activist Noam Chomsky recently participated in an interview covering several important topics:

## On AI and education

- ChatGPT and similar AI systems are just "high-tech plagiarism" and have no value for real understanding or education. They can make plagiarism harder to detect but don't help students learn.

- The educational system is failing by being uninteresting to students. Real education should engage student interests and concerns. 

- The goal should be preparing students to participate effectively in a democratic society, not just teaching to standardized tests.

## On climate change 

- Climate change is a far bigger crisis than the pandemic. But research and efforts to address it are being cut back while fossil fuel use increases.

- Capitalism has gone berserk, focused only on short term profits at the expense of long term destruction. Sane voices like the UN Secretary General calling for change are ignored.

## On the pandemic

- The pandemic is still raging in the US, one of the worst global responses. But funding for research and vaccines has declined, failing to prepare for future pandemics.

- In contrast, China has saved millions of lives with its pandemic response and restrictions. But it gets no credit due to anti-China propaganda.

## On vaccines

- The unvaccinated should have the freedom to refuse vaccines but also the responsibility to honor institutions' requirements to protect others. Like following traffic laws, it's not an undue burden on freedom.
