## Overview

This post provides a step-by-step guide on using DeepFaceLab to create deepfake videos by swapping faces. DeepFaceLab is an open source deepfake tool that utilizes deep learning for facial manipulation and synthesis.

## Steps

1. Download and install DeepFaceLab
2. Prepare source and destination videos
   - Extract frames from videos into images
3. Detect and align faces
   - Extract faces from source frames
   - Extract faces from destination frames
   - Delete incorrectly detected faces
4. Train the AI model
   - Start training process
   - Iteratively improve model
   - Save model once satisfied with results 
5. Merge source and destination faces
   - Adjust face blending with erode, blur, etc
   - Apply settings to all frames
6. Export final video

## Results

With minimal effort, DeepFaceLab can produce convincing face swaps and deepfakes. However, for best results it helps to:

- Have well aligned source and destination faces 
- Train the model extensively (100K+ iterations)
- Capture faces from multiple angles

Overall, DeepFaceLab provides an accessible deepfake tool to create photorealistic face swaps. With sufficient training data and model iterations, highly convincing results are possible.
