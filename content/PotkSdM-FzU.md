## Introduction

Face swapping is the process of replacing a face in an image with a different face, while maintaining the original facial expression and head position. This can be done using AI tools like [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and [Automatic1111](https://automatic1111.github.io/stable-diffusion-webui/). In this post, we will discuss how to use Automatic1111 and its RuBE extension to easily swap faces in images.

## Installing Automatic1111 and RuBE

To use Automatic1111 for face swapping, you first need to install it along with the RuBE extension:

1. Install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) with the required components like Python and C++.

2. Clone the Automatic1111 repository from GitHub and follow the installation instructions.

3. Install the RuBE extension from the Automatic1111 extensions library. 

4. Restart Automatic1111 after installing the extensions.

## Using RuBE for Face Swapping 

Once Automatic1111 and RuBE are installed, face swapping is straightforward:

1. Upload or generate an image in Automatic1111. 

2. Upload the source face image that you want to swap in.

3. Drag the source face image onto the RuBE tab.

4. Click on 'Enable' and select your preferred AI model like GFPGAN.

5. Click on 'Generate' to render the image with the swapped face.

RuBE will seamlessly replace the target face with the source face, while preserving the original facial expression and orientation.

## Benefits

- Easily swap faces without training lora models.

- Can restore and improve poorly generated faces.

- Works for both text-to-image and image-to-image generation.

- Allows swapping multiple faces by using multiple RuBE tabs.

## Limitations

- Face shapes should match for best results.

- Can cause distortion if face shapes are very different.

Overall, RuBE provides a simple and effective way to swap faces in AI generated images using Automatic1111. With some experimentation, high quality face swaps can be achieved.
