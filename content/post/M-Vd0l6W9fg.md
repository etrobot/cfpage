## Introduction

Roop is a new extension for swapping faces in images generated with Stable Diffusion. It allows you to easily replace a face in an image with a different face from another image.

## Installation

Installing Roop in Stable Diffusion is very easy. Just go to the Extensions tab in the UI, click on "Load from URL" under the Available section, and install the Roop extension from the SD Web UI Extensions group. After installing, enable Roop in the Installed tab and restart the UI.

Roop is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ Automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui-Roop), where you can find extra tips and information, like needing to install Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows.

## Usage

To use Roop, first generate an image with at least one face. Roop will only swap existing faces in images, so it requires a starting image with a face.

Enable Roop in the extensions sidebar and select a face image. Then click Generate to swap the selected face into the image.

Roop has options to control face restoration quality, upscaling, and more. Restoring the face is important for quality, as seen when turning it off results in a blurry face.

You can provide a comma separated list of faces to swap multiple faces in an image.

One limitation is Roop tends to output photorealistic faces. So cartoony faces don't swap as cleanly. But it works great for making lively portraits from old paintings!

## Conclusion

Roop makes face swapping in Stable Diffusion a breeze. It's an easy way to customize faces for portraits, paintings, and more. Just enable, provide the new face, and generate for seamless face swaps.
