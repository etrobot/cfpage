## Overview

Threads is a new text-focused app from Meta, similar to Twitter. It syncs with your Instagram account. Since Threads is a brand new platform, it presents a huge opportunity to build an audience and get traction if you start posting content now. 

ChatGPT is an AI assistant that can generate written content for you. By combining ChatGPT and Threads, you can fully automate creating and scheduling posts.

## Steps to Automate

1. Create a Threads account and optimize your profile with keywords
2. Follow leaders in your niche and comment on their posts 
3. Create a prompt for ChatGPT to generate posts 
4. Generate posts and organize them in a spreadsheet
5. Copy/paste posts directly to Threads for now 
6. Look for a Threads post scheduler app (coming soon)
7. Link scheduler to your spreadsheet to auto-post

## Tips for Success

- Make controversial posts to spark discussion 
- Ask stupid questions to get engagement
- Post as much as possible - you can't overload platforms this big
- Comment on viral posts in your niche 
- Avoid sharing links in posts - share via DM instead
- Ask ChatGPT to create viral posts for you

Automating Threads with ChatGPT is an easy way to build a following and get traction on a new platform. Consistency is key - keep posting daily with AI support.
