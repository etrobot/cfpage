ChatGPT can be a useful tool for generating content and ideas when writing your resume. Here are some tips:

## Use ChatGPT to Create Resume Bullet Points

- Ask ChatGPT to "create resume bullet points for [job title]" 
- It will generate relevant accomplishment-oriented bullet points that you can tailor to your own experience
- This gives you a starting point instead of a blank page 

For example:

"Create resume bullet points for Content Strategist role"

This may produce bullets like:

- Developed and executed content strategy that increased website traffic by 20%
- Led team of 5 content creators to produce over 500 pieces of optimized content
- Implemented new content tracking system resulting in improved content ROI

## Customize the Bullet Points

- Don't copy the bullets verbatim - customize them to accurately reflect your accomplishments
- Change details like percentages or numbers that may not be exactly applicable
- Only include achievements you can confidently discuss and quantify in an interview

## Use as a Brainstorming Tool

- Even if you don't use the exact phrasing, ChatGPT can spark ideas to showcase your skills
- The bullets can jog your memory about projects and contributions you've made

Overall, think of ChatGPT as a starting point to build upon, not a resume writer. With some editing and customization, it can help you create an effective, achievement-focused resume quickly.
