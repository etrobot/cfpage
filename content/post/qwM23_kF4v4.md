In this post, we'll walk through how to build your own AI assistant similar to ChatGPT using tools like OpenAI and GitHub Copilot.

## Overview

- We'll build a chat interface using React 
- We'll create a backend server with Node.js and Express to communicate with OpenAI's API
- We'll configure multiple AI models like Codex to use for different prompts
- We'll allow custom prompts and conversations with the AI assistant

## Tools Used

- OpenAI API
- ChatGPT model
- GitHub Copilot for auto-generating code
- React for frontend 
- Node.js and Express for backend server

## Steps

### 1. Build the Frontend with React

- Create the React app with `create-react-app`
- Add a sidebar menu and chat interface layout with CSS
- Design the chat bubbles and avatars for user and AI messages

### 2. Set Up the Backend Server

- Initialize Node.js server with Express 
- Install OpenAI and configure API key 
- Create routes to call OpenAI API with different prompts

### 3. Connect the Frontend and Backend

- Fetch the models list from backend on app load
- Send user chat messages to backend API route
- Display AI responses back in chat interface

### 4. Allow Switching AI Models

- List different AI engines available from OpenAI 
- Let user select model like Codex for coding questions
- Change model used in API call based on user selection

And that's it! With these steps, you can build your own customizable AI assistant with chat interface powered by OpenAI.
