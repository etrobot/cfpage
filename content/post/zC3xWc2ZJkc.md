### Introduction

Peter Levels is an indie hacker who earns $2.7 million per year with zero employees. He achieved this impressive success starting with just $1000 in his pocket in 2013. 

### The Slow Road to Overnight Success

Levels tried over 70 projects before finally finding success with [Nomadlist](https:/omadlist.com/), a forum for digital nomads. For years his projects failed to gain traction. But he persisted through the failures and eventually Nomadlist took off as remote work trended upwards. 

This exemplifies the common trajectory of massive success: slow progress at first, followed by exponential growth. Consistency over the long-haul is key. 

### Two Pillars of Consistency

There are two main pillars of consistency that helped Levels achieve his success:

#### 1. Passion

It's crucial to work on projects you're passionate about. Otherwise it's easy to let them die from inactivity. Treat your projects like a baby that needs regular care and feeding. 

If you have to force yourself to use your own product, that's a sign you're building the wrong thing. Work on projects that genuinely excite you.

#### 2. Simplicity 

Keep your code base and product features as simple as possible. Complexity will discourage you from persevering. Build the bare minimum viable product, avoiding unnecessary bells and whistles.

Write a minimal set of tests for your core functionality to enable faster shipping. Don't over-engineer.

### Conclusion

Consistency over the long-term is critical for achieving massive success as an indie hacker. To maintain consistency, build projects you're passionate about and keep things as simple as possible. Let passion and simplicity drive you through the slow times until your work gains momentum.
