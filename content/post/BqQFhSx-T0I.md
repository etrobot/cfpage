A new AI tool called Dragon is poised to revolutionize image editing. Created by researchers from Google, MIT and Max Planck Institute, Dragon allows users to easily edit images in ways that are extremely difficult or impossible to do manually in Photoshop.

## How Dragon Works

Dragon is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), an AI technique where two neural networks compete against each other to generate increasingly realistic images. Over many iterations, the "generator" network learns to create images that can fool the "discriminator" network.

With Dragon, users simply click and drag parts of an image to edit it. The tool understands concepts like object rigidity and can generate new content like teeth when a mouth is stretched into a smile. This allows seamless edits that would take hours of work in Photoshop.

## Implications

The simplicity and power of Dragon will disrupt many industries including:

- **Photo editing** - Tasks like compositing and retouching will become trivial. Photoshop skills may no longer be as valuable.

- **Film/animation** - Dragon can help generate frames, characters and assets to accelerate production. It lowers the barrier for creating DIY films/animation.

- **Art/design** - Artists can quickly iterate designs and illustrations. Design mockups can be generated with little effort.

- **Manipulation** - The technology could also be misused to create convincing fake imagery and videos.

Dragon represents a major leap in AI-enabled creativity and imagination. Once released, it will enable new applications we can only begin to imagine now. The technology will continue rapidly improving, so its full impacts have yet to be seen.
