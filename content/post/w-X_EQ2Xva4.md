## Overview

This post explains how to use Python and ChatGPT to automate repetitive tasks. We will use the OpenAI API to generate Python scripts that can extract and translate headers from a blog post, as well as clean up old files from a downloads folder.

## Tools Used

- Python - programming language used to write the automation scripts
- ChatGPT - AI assistant used to generate Python code via the OpenAI API 
- OpenAI API - interface for requesting AI-generated text from ChatGPT and other models

## Automating Blog Post Header Translation

To automate translation of headers from a blog post to Spanish:

1. Send a prompt to ChatGPT via the OpenAI API asking for a Python script to extract all headers from a web page, translate them to Spanish, and save the result to an HTML file.

2. Take the generated Python code and make minor adjustments:
   - Install required libraries like BeautifulSoup and Google Translate
   - Preserve header hierarchy when saving translated headers to HTML

3. Run the script on a blog post to extract and translate all headers to Spanish

## Automating Downloads Folder Clean Up 

To automatically clean up old files from a downloads folder:

1. Prompt ChatGPT to generate Python code that checks file modified dates in the downloads folder and moves files older than 30 days to a 'toDelete' folder.

2. The auto-generated Python script works perfectly with no adjustments needed:
   - Checks if 'toDelete' folder exists, creates it if needed
   - Loops through downloads files, gets modified datetimes
   - Moves old files to 'toDelete' folder

3. Executing the script successfully moves all old downloads to the 'toDelete' folder for manual clean up.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT can generate surprisingly effective Python automation scripts that require minimal adjustments. With the right prompts, it's possible to automate repetitive tasks and save significant time.
