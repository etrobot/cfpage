## Overview

There are new AI tools like GPT engineer that can automatically generate code from simple prompts. This allows creating full applications with backend, frontend, APIs, etc in minutes. While this greatly improves efficiency, it also threatens the jobs of many developers, especially junior developers.

## Key Points

- GPT engineer is a new tool that uses GPT-3/GPT-4 to generate complete code bases from prompts
- It can create working apps with Python/FastAPI backends and React/TypeScript frontends 
- Still some limitations but capabilities are expanding rapidly
- In short term, AI will augment developers and improve efficiency
- But in future, many dev jobs especially junior roles could be replaced
- Best bet is to focus on high-level design skills that AI lacks

## How To Use

- Install with `pip install GPT-engineer`
- Provide OpenAI API key 
- Create prompt file describing app to build 
- Run `gpt-engineer <prompt-folder>`
- It will generate full codebase

## Concerns

- Replaces mundane coding work and could obsolete many devs
- Junior dev roles especially threatened as AI handles training tasks  
- Raises issues around copyright, security, privacy of AI generated code
- But companies have incentive to use AI even if imperfect
- Long term, even senior dev jobs could be impacted as AI improves

## Opportunities

- In short term, AI will augment devs and improve efficiency
- Can focus on high-level design that requires creativity
- If we leverage AI as a tool, it does not replace us but augments us
- Need to develop higher thinking skills that AI lacks
