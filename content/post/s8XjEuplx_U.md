Python is a versatile programming language that can be used to automate many repetitive and tedious tasks. This allows us to be more productive by spending less time on mundane work. Here are some examples of how Python can be used to automate common daily tasks:

## Web Scraping
Beautiful Soup and Requests packages in Python can be used to extract content from websites. This allows automating the collection of data from the web. For example, daily weather reports or stock prices can be extracted. 

## PDF Parsing
PDF documents contain useful information in an unstructured format. Python packages like Camelot and PDFMiner allow extracting tables and text from PDF files. This can automate fetching data from PDF reports, bank statements etc.

## Image Processing
The Python imaging library Pillow provides functions for image manipulation like resizing, format conversion etc. This can be used to automate processing of large number of images.

## Text Summarization
Python libraries like Gensim and NLTK implement algorithms that can summarize large texts. This can be very useful for automating the creation of summaries from long articles or documents.

In summary, Python provides easy to use libraries and packages to automate many common tasks that are otherwise tedious or time consuming if done manually. Automating such tasks improves efficiency and productivity.
