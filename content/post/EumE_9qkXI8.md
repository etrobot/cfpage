The construction industry accounts for 30-40% of the world's total energy use and carbon emissions. Architect Vinu Daniel argues we can build more sustainably by using local, natural materials like mud and incorporating waste materials into construction.

## Tools and Techniques

- Mud bricks - Compressed mud bricks with 5% cement can be stronger than fired bricks. Daniel's team taught local masons mud techniques.
- Compressed earth blocks - Made by the Auroville Earth Institute, these are twice as strong as fired bricks.
- Rammed earth - Used for foundations instead of concrete.
- Mud and tire construction - Tires can be incorporated into walls and buildings to give them strength and make use of waste.

## Benefits

- Lower cost - A 90,000 dollar mud and trash house compared to 200,000+ for conventional building.
- Lower carbon - Materials like mud have very low embodied energy.
- Local materials - Reduces transportation emissions.
- Waste reduction - Materials like plastic bottles and tires can be kept out of landfills. 

Daniel argues that we can find solutions and even beauty in the waste we have created like tires and bottles. Rather than thoughtlessly dumping waste, we can incorporate it into constructive solutions.
