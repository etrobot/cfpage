Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen tremendous advances in recent years, with systems like ChatGPT demonstrating new capabilities in natural language processing. However, there are also growing concerns about the risks posed by advanced AI systems. 

I recently had the chance to speak with Alexander Wang, CEO of Scale AI, about the state of AI technology today. Scale AI provides data labeling and annotation services to companies developing AI systems.

## The Role of Scale AI

Scale AI helps companies train AI models by labeling and filtering large datasets. This ensures the data used is high quality and leads to better model performance. As Wang explained:

> "At the end of the day, all of these algorithms boil down to the data that they are trained on... Our view is that enterprises, and anyone using these models, needs to know how to use these data and their own know-how, their own trade secrets, to combine with these interfaces to build experiences that are new, refreshing, different, and powerful to provide a lot of value to their customers."

Scale AI works with organizations across industries, from tech companies like Microsoft to government agencies like the Department of Defense. 

## Evaluating AI Safety

As AI becomes more advanced, concerns are growing about potential risks. I asked Wang about evaluating the safety of AI systems. He emphasized the need for extensive testing and review of models before release:

> "It’s critical to the AI in history is doing this work in testing and evaluating these models in parallel alongside development and progress in AI."

Wang said Scale AI is working with the White House on public evaluation of AI systems to understand risks and ensure responsible development. He argued that proper oversight and regulation will be critical going forward across industries like healthcare and transportation that adopt AI.

## The Role of Humans 

To build AI that is human-centric, Wang believes we need data that reflects collective human knowledge and values. Scale AI employs a large workforce to review data being used to train AI models. As Wang stated:

> "We don’t believe in walled gardens, we don’t believe in a small group of individuals, or a small group of engineers, deciding how this technology should look for the entire world."

Involving more perspectives results in AI that better serves everyone.

The conversation reinforced that while AI promises exciting innovation, ensuring it is developed safely and ethically will require coordination between policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders. Ongoing evaluation and regulation of these rapidly advancing technologies will be crucial.
