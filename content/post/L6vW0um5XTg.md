## Introduction

Recently, I discovered an amazing AI chatbot called ChatGPT that can generate code upon request. I was fascinated by its capabilities, so I decided to put it to the test by having it create an entire simple 2D video game for me. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process and tools I used.

## Tools Needed

- Unity Game Engine
- ChatGPT AI Assistant

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Come up with a simple game idea

I decided to make a top-down shooter where the player moves by shooting. The goal is to defeat enemies and earn a high score. 

### 2. Generate code snippets with ChatGPT

I described the game idea to ChatGPT and had it generate code for:

- Player movement and damage
- Weapon shooting and knockback 
- Projectile spawning and destruction
- Enemy spawning and damage
- Scoring system
- Restarting logic

### 3. Tweak and integrate the code into Unity

I copied the code snippets into Unity scripts and made small tweaks so everything would work together properly. The AI-written code needed some adaptation for 2D and to follow best practices.

### 4. Build out the game scene and visuals

I created placeholder art assets and built the game environment around the code framework ChatGPT produced. This included things like:

- Setting up the player, enemies, projectiles, and terrain
- Creating a UI for the score
- Adding background music and sound effects

### 5. Export and share the completed game

After some final tweaks, I exported the game and published it online. Despite being made entirely from AI-generated code, it turned into a neat little playable game!

## Results

In the end, I was really impressed with ChatGPT's ability to produce functional game code from scratch in just a few hours. With some human oversight, it can be a powerful tool for rapid prototyping and GameDev. I'm excited to see how AI assistants will continue to evolve in the future.

So if you want to try having an AI make a game for you, give ChatGPT a shot! It's a fun way to experiment with AI capabilities.
