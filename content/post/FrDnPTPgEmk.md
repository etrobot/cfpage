At IBM THINK 2023, IBM showed how businesses can harness foundation models and AI to create value. Here are some key ideas:

## Act with Urgency
- This is a transformative moment for AI. Be bold and capture the opportunity.

## Be an AI Value Creator
- Build models on your data, under your control. They will become your most valuable assets. Don't just be an API user.

## Bet on Community 
- Leverage open AI community innovation. One model will not rule them all.

## Run Everywhere Efficiently
- Use open hybrid cloud technologies for performance, latency and cost optimization.

## Build Responsibly
- Put governance and transparency into the heart of your AI lifecycle.

## Key IBM AI Tools
- Watson X - Integrated data and AI platform
- IBM Models - Pretrained models for enterprise
- Vela - Cloud native AI supercomputer
- Telum NC16 - AI inferencing chip 
- IBM Research AIU - Optimized for foundation models

By following these principles and using tools like Watson X, businesses can harness the power of foundation models to create real value.
