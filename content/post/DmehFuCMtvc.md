Many successful startups had to pivot and change their idea before finding product-market fit. Pivoting is common in the startup world - it means changing your startup idea because the current idea is not working. 

Y Combinator partners share stories of famous pivots:

- Brex started as a VR headset company before pivoting into business payments
- Goat began as a group dinner startup and pivoted to a sneaker marketplace 
- Clipboard Health pivoted from a nurse hiring platform to a healthcare staffing business

It's important to validate your idea quickly so you don't waste time on something no one wants. Talk to real customers to find the right problem to solve. Look for that "hell yes" moment. 

To decide whether to pivot, focus on core metrics. If your key metric is not growing, it's time to make a change. Some pivots keep the same product but change the audience. Others build something new for the same users. Changing the founders is the only thing you can't pivot.

The key is to start somewhere so you can learn about the market. The market itself will teach you if you ask the right questions and listen. Many founders have to try the wrong thing first before finding the right idea.
