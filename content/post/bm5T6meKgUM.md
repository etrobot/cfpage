## Introduction

This post outlines a tutorial for creating a deepfake video using only a single image as the source for the target face. This method is fast and can produce remarkably realistic results. 

## Tools Used

The main tools used in this tutorial are:

- Google Colab - To run the deepfake model code
- Deepfake Model - The core model that generates the deepfake. This model only needs a single image to work.

## Steps

The key steps are:

1. Upload the source video and target image to Google Colab 
2. Clone the repository and load the deepfake model
3. Replace the video and image placeholders in the code
4. Run the code to generate the deepfake 

The process takes around 5 minutes in total.

## Results

The output is a new video with the target face replaced on the original video. The results look very realistic while only needing a single image as input.

## Considerations

It's important to use this technology responsibly and avoid generating deepfakes with inappropriate content. Follow all legal and ethical guidelines when working with deepfakes.

Overall, this tutorial provides an efficient way to create convincing deepfakes with minimal input images required.
