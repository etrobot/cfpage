ChatGPT plugins are exploding in popularity, with new ones coming out every day. With so many options, it can be hard to know which plugins are worth your time. In this post, we'll walk you through a process for reviewing and ranking ChatGPT plugins, so you can find the hidden gems.

## Step 1: Browse the Plugin Store
First, head over to the [ChatGPT Plugin Store](https://plugins.chatgpt.com/) and browse around. Check out the "Popular" and "New" sections to get a sense of what's out there. 

As you're browsing, make a list of plugins that catch your eye. Aim to select around 10-20 plugins to review more closely.

## Step 2: Test the Plugins
Now it's time to actually try using the plugins! Install each one and test it out with a few different prompts. 

As you test them, pay attention to:

- **Features**: What does this plugin allow you to do? Does it have any special capabilities?

- **Performance**: How well does the plugin work? Does it deliver accurate, relevant results?

- **Ease of use**: Is the plugin intuitive and easy to use? Does it require any complicated setup?

- **Value**: Does this plugin save you time or provide unique value?

## Step 3: Rank the Plugins
Once you've tested all the plugins, it's time to rank them! Come up with a rating scale, like S, A, B, C, D. 

Some factors to consider when rating:

- Features and capabilities
- Accuracy and relevance of results  
- Ease of use and setup required
- Uniqueness and value added
- Bugs and performance issues

Make sure to test each plugin thoroughly before assigning a final rating. And don't forget to have fun discovering new plugins and integrations!

## Bonus: Automate for Ongoing Discoveries
For ongoing plugin discoveries, you can automate some of the process using a tool like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). 

Set up a Zap to notify you whenever new plugins are added to the store. Then you can quickly test them and add ratings to a Notion table or Airtable database.

Automation makes it easy to stay on top of new releases so you never miss out on a game-changing new plugin.
