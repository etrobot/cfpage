## Overview

Scale AI is a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2016 that provides data labeling and annotation services to help companies develop AI models. It was founded by Lucy Guo and Alexander Wang and has raised over $600 million in funding. 

## Key Facts

- Scale started as an API for human tasks called Scale API before pivoting to focus on AI data labeling.

- It provides training data for self-driving car companies like Toyota, Honda, Waymo and Cruise. 

- Scale has over 600 employees and works with companies like Meta, Microsoft, Instacart, Fox, and the US military.

- In 2022, Scale generated $250 million in revenue.

- Scale's core products include Scale Data Engine, Scale Donovan, Scale Spellbook and Remote Tasks.

- Remote Tasks is Scale's in-house outsourcing agency that employs over 240,000 low-cost data labelers globally. This raised concerns around poor working conditions.

## Looking Ahead

As AI advances, Scale aims to play a key role in maintaining America's AI supremacy against threats from China and Russia. An important concern is ensuring AI has human values aligned.
