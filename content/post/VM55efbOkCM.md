## Overview

This post describes an experiment using ChatGPT and other AI tools to automate sending customized messages to Tinder matches. The goal was to build an automated system to send engaging opening messages to matches on Tinder.

## Tools Used

- ChatGPT - to generate pickup lines and opening messages 
- OpenAI API - to interface with ChatGPT
- Selenium - to automate logging in and interacting with the Tinder website
- Python - to code the bot

## Implementation 

1. Use Selenium to login to Tinder and auto-swipe right to get matches
2. Get match names and profile links using Selenium
3. Feed match names into ChatGPT prompts to generate custom pickup lines
4. Send the messages to matches

## Results

The bot was able to successfully login, get matches, generate messages, and send them. The messages were a mix of weird AI-generated pickup lines and more normal introductions.

## Future Improvements

- Use match bios and photos to further customize messages
- Moderate weird messages before sending 
- Add video chat using avatar chatbots

## Conclusion

Automating Tinder message sending with AI is possible but needs refinement to improve quality. With further development this could be a useful tool for online dating automation.
