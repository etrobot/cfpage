<p>Real estate can be an incredibly lucrative business, but it&rsquo;s notoriously difficult for new agents to build momentum and start closing deals, especially in their first few months.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so impressed when I came across the story of Amanda Aguiar. Amanda is a new, part-time real estate agent based in Seattle who managed to close over $80,000 in commissions within just her first 4 months, entirely through leads generated from social media.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll summarize Amanda&rsquo;s interview where she shares her social media strategies and provides a blueprint that any agent can follow to build momentum right out the gate using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.</p>
<h2 id="amandas-backstory">Amanda&rsquo;s Backstory</h2>
<p>Amanda had been working in customer support and experience for most of her career but felt stagnant and unfulfilled. Although she was hesitant at first, a close friend kept encouraging her to get into real estate over the course of 2 years.</p>
<p>She finally decided to take the leap, got her real estate license, and created a 1 year plan to give it her all and see if it worked out. If it didn&rsquo;t, she could always go back to her old career.</p>
<h2 id="generating-leads-through-social-media">Generating Leads Through Social Media</h2>
<p>Rather than taking the traditional route of cold calling and door knocking, Amanda decided to focus all her efforts on generating leads through social media. Here were some of her key strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She turned her personal Instagram account into a real estate-focused profile. This allowed her to leverage her existing network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She started posting real estate focused content daily on Instagram - market updates, local area highlights, listings etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She shared listings from her teammates to supplement her own content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She leveraged local Facebook groups by introducing herself and offering to help anyone looking for an agent. Group members now tag her whenever there&rsquo;s a relevant post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She set up referral incentives to encourage people to send her business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She announced her new career across all platforms and offered to help anyone looking to buy/sell.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quickly-building-trust-and-converting-leads">Quickly Building Trust and Converting Leads</h2>
<p>The key to Amanda&rsquo;s success was that the leads from social media already had a baseline level of trust and connection. This allowed her to convert a much higher percentage compared to cold outreach.</p>
<p>Her process was to follow up immediately with anyone who reached out to schedule a call or meetup. She focused on listening and understanding their needs first rather than jumping into a sales pitch.</p>
<p>For buyers, she actually started providing listings and helping them look at homes before having a signed agreement in place. This built further trust and made it smooth to formalize the relationship.</p>
<p>In just 4 months, Amanda has already closed 6 deals all through social media leads. This includes two $1M+ luxury listings that she acquired through contacts made online.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-new-agents">Advice for New Agents</h2>
<p>Here are some of Amanda&rsquo;s top tips for new real estate agents looking to build momentum:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have 90 day goals rather than just annual goals. This allows you to course correct more frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write down affirmations and visualize yourself hitting your targets. This focuses the mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block time for consistent social media posting and outreach. Consistency is key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentically engage with people online. Don&rsquo;t try to be someone you&rsquo;re not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow other successful agents and local influencers for content ideas. Put your own spin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use videos and shorts to maximize reach. Photos get lost in the feed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage existing contacts by announcing your new career across platforms. Offer to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide value first without expectations to build relationships. This breeds trust.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amanda&rsquo;s success just goes to show that with the right social media strategies and mindset, new agents can build incredible momentum without relying on old school prospecting tactics. Her approach of cultivating highly qualified, warm leads online is the future of the industry.</p>
